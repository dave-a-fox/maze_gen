# maze_gen
This is a program that uses stack and linked list data structures to create a randomized maze. 
The user is prompted for a row and column size and a speed at which each step of the maze is displayed in seconds.
The maze is generated step by step using an [iteration algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm). 
The data structures used are by Kenneth Lambert.
